### Hi, I'm George ðŸ‘‹
---

Hi, my name is George and I'm a rails developer working remotely from a small village in England called 
[Barnt Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnt_Green){:target="\_blank"}. I currently work at 
[FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com/){:target="\_blank"}, and _to be honest_, I'm perfectly happy here. However,
when I saw that you guys were hiring, I simply couldn't resist the opportunity to apply...



### Why 37signals?
---

Firstly, Basecamp, Hey, and Campfire are all great products which I'd love to
contribute to.

Secondly, having read Rework and Remote, I'm confident that I would fit in well. I'm all
onboard for no unnecessary meetings, no pointless processes, just a focus on building great
products and doing great work. In fact, I like to think we work in a similar way at FreeAgent.

Thirdly, I love working with rails. I love its simplicity, focus on
conventions, and the speed at which I can create things. With many cool things coming to the rails
ecosystem, e.g., Solid Cache, Solid Queue, Mission Control, etc., I would love to work with the
team that builds the framework I use every day.

### Why me?
---

Firstly, I already have experience of putting Rails (and the Hotwire stack) to work since it's the main technology
I use at FreeAgent. For example, recently I've been working on a feature that
allows users to set default payment methods for their invoices. This involved
setting up a new database table/model, adding various controllers and views, implementing new API endpoints,
and a new Stimulus controller and Turbo Stream on the frontend to apply new defaults to the invoice form dynamically.

Secondly, I think I could bring a lot to the team. Here's why:

1. I am optimistic and try to bring a positive energy. E.g., this
    attitude is reflected in my code review comments, and discussions about
    upcoming work ideas.
2. I'm self sufficient. I'm used to working remotely, figuring things out myself, and knowing when to ask for support.
3. I've received positive feedback from my colleagues at FreeAgent (see below).

      You're an extremely competent developer with a strong technical understanding, 
      who is also keen to learn new things and to use techniques you have seen others use successfully.

      You're a great collaborator and fun to work with. You bring interesting ideas and new
      perspectives on our work which is very much appreciated.

      George's refactoring skills are consistently at a good level, with feedback from 
      [NAME OF PRINCIPAL] in how impressed he is with how George's PRs are structured. He works to keep them as small as possible.

### I'm not a robot
---

Yes, I do have a life outside of work. I love connecting with my creative side
through photography (see my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/georgestephenbaker/){:target="blank"}),
running to keep fit, and travelling to
various European cities.

Me (probably) hard at work:
