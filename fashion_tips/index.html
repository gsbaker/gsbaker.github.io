<h4 id="1-materials-construction-and-fit">1. Materials, construction, and fit</h4>
<hr />

<p>It is more important to consider the materials, construction, and fit of a piece of clothing than the brand. Just
because an item has a particular brand label‚Äîe.g., Armani Exchange‚Äîdoes not mean that it is worth its price.
<em>Expensive does not equal high quality.</em></p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>A lot of cheaply made clothes and footwear are manufactured using synthetic fibres like polyester and acrylic. I would
recommend avoiding the aforementioned materials in most garments except outerwear‚Äîi.e., coats and
jackets‚Äîand sportswear.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/materials_info.jpeg" alt="Materials info" /></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption mb-3">Always check the materials information when shopping online. This ASOS jumper
is made from synthetics which are inferior to wool.</figcaption>

<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>

<p>Most clothes are machine stitched in a factory. Handmade clothes often have a superior construction‚Äîe.g., suits‚Äîbut this
can have a big impact on price.</p>

<p><strong>Fit</strong></p>

<p>I recommend learning your key measurements‚Äîe.g., chest size. Ill-fitting clothing and footwear‚Äîno matter the quality,
price, or any other variable‚Äîis not worth it.</p>

<h4 id="2-go-for-a-classic-style">2. Go for a classic style</h4>
<hr />

<p>The big advantage of a classic style is that it will never go out of fashion: suits, blazers, shirts, and
a classic pear of jeans will always make a man look stylish.</p>

<p>I recommend avoiding so-called <em>‚Äúfashion forward‚Äù</em> items for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>they are often cheaply made and not to last;</li>
  <li>trends die out quickly.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also recommend investing in versatile pieces of clothing‚Äîe.g., neutral colours‚Äîbecause they can be worn often.</p>

<h4 id="3-quality-over-quantity">3. Quality over quantity</h4>
<hr />

<p>From experience, I think that it is better to buy one quality clothing item‚Äîwhich might be expensive‚Äîrather than
multiple cheaper ones.</p>

<p><em>Avoid impulse purchases</em>. I have a rule: if I want something, I add it to a list; if that item is
still on said list after two weeks, I can afford it, and it‚Äôs a good investment, I buy it. A good investment is
something that will often be worn; think about the <em>cost-per-wear</em>.</p>

<h4 id="4-dress-for-your-environment">4. Dress for your environment</h4>
<hr />

<p>Outfit choice should <em>heavily</em> depend on the climate you find yourself in. E.g., I live in the UK where it often
rains; my clothing should reflect that. It is also important to note that <em>dressing practically does not mean you have
to compromise on style</em>; in fact, function and style can often go hand in hand‚Äîlook at the iconic Burberry trench coat.</p>

<p>I think it is also helpful to consider the original purpose of certain items of clothing and footwear. E.g., Converse were originally designed as basketball shoes‚Äîit is therefore no wonder they are completely impractical as everyday footwear.</p>

<h4 id="5-never-buy-anything-without-research">5. Never buy anything without research</h4>
<hr />

<p><em>Avoid buying items of clothing and footwear based solely on looks.</em> I highly recommend researching a particular item
of clothing before you decide whether to buy it.</p>

<p>Use Reddit to find out what other people think of a certain brand or product‚Äîjust Google search ‚Äúbest men‚Äôs
<em>insert item</em> <strong>reddit</strong>‚Äù, or ‚Äúis a <em>insert item</em> worth it <strong>reddit</strong>‚Äù, or ‚Äúquality of <em>x brand</em> <strong>reddit</strong>‚Äù.
Sometimes, there can be lots of conflicting opinions on Reddit. Therefore, I recommend using it as a source of opinions
rather than truth. Having said that, I have found the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice">r/malefashionadvice</a>
subreddit to be quite useful.</p>

<p>For researching footwear, the best place on the internet is without a doubt the YouTube channel
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RoseAnvil">Rose Anvil</a>. He literally cuts shoes in half, explains what is in them, and
offers his expert opinion on if they are worth it.</p>

<p>Another YouTube channel that I highly recommend is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gentlemansgazette">The Gentleman‚Äôs Gazette</a>
which offers detailed content about classic men‚Äôs style. I particularly like their series of videos called
<em>‚ÄúIs it worth it?‚Äù</em>.</p>
