    <h3 id="hi-im-george-">Hi, I‚Äôm George üëã</h3>
<hr />

<p>Hi, my name is George and I‚Äôm a rails developer working remotely from a small village in England called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnt_Green" target="\_blank">Barnt Green</a>. I currently work at 
<a href="https://www.freeagent.com/" target="\_blank">FreeAgent</a>, and <em>to be honest</em>, I‚Äôm perfectly happy here. However,
when I saw that you guys were hiring, I simply couldn‚Äôt resist the opportunity to apply‚Ä¶</p>

<h3 id="why-37signals">Why 37signals?</h3>
<hr />

<p>Firstly, Basecamp, Hey, and Campfire are all great products which I‚Äôd love to
contribute to.</p>

<p>Secondly, having read Rework and Remote, I‚Äôm confident that I would fit in well. I‚Äôm all
onboard for no unnecessary meetings, no pointless processes, just a focus on building great
products and doing great work. In fact, I like to think we work in a similar way at FreeAgent.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I love working with rails. I love its simplicity, focus on
conventions, and the speed at which I can create things. With many cool things coming to the rails
ecosystem, e.g., Solid Cache, Solid Queue, Mission Control, etc., I would love to work with the
team that builds the framework I use every day.</p>

<h3 id="why-me">Why me?</h3>
<hr />

<p>Firstly, I already have experience of putting Rails (and the Hotwire stack) to work since it‚Äôs the main technology
I use at FreeAgent. For example, recently I‚Äôve been working on a feature that
allows users to set default payment methods for their invoices. This involved
setting up a new database table/model, adding various controllers and views, implementing new API endpoints,
and a new Stimulus controller and Turbo Stream on the frontend to apply new defaults to the invoice form dynamically.</p>

<p>Secondly, I think I could bring a lot to the team. Here‚Äôs why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am optimistic and try to bring a positive energy. E.g., this
 attitude is reflected in my code review comments, and discussions about
 upcoming work ideas.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm self sufficient. I‚Äôm used to working remotely, figuring things out myself, and knowing when to ask for support.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve received positive feedback from my colleagues at FreeAgent (see below).</li>
</ol>

      You're an extremely competent developer with a strong technical understanding, 
      who is also keen to learn new things and to use techniques you have seen others use successfully.

    <div class="quote">
  
        You're a great collaborator and fun to work with. You bring interesting ideas and new
        perspectives on our work which is very much appreciated.

    George's refactoring skills are consistently at a good level, with feedback from 
    [NAME OF PRINCIPAL] in how impressed he is with how George's PRs are structured. He works to keep them as small as possible.

<h3 id="im-not-a-robot">I‚Äôm not a robot</h3>
<hr />

<p>Yes, I do have a life outside of work. I love connecting with my creative side
through photography (see my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/georgestephenbaker/" target="blank">Instagram</a>),
running to keep fit, and travelling to
various European cities.</p>

<p>Me (probably) hard at work:</p>
