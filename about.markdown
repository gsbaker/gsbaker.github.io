Hi, my name is George.

Iâ€™m a [computer science](https://english.stackexchange.com/a/223162) student at the [University of Birmingham](cs.bham.ac.uk) and an aspiring software developer.

I write about things that interest me, and I try and stick as close to the facts as possible.

You can find more about me by visiting my [personal webpage](www.gsbaker.uk).
