> Minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from it

## Living with less
Minimalism to me means living with less.

Life is complicated, and I don’t want material things to complicate mine further.

If I’m **not getting any value out of a possession** (e.g. a piece of clothing), I **get rid of it**.

This helps me to **avoid clutter**, and enables me to replace things I don’t like.


## Simplicity

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

Minimalism to me means simplicity.

I think simplicity is the **absence of clutter** and unnecessary complexity.

Not only is there beauty in simplicity, I also find that my life is better when I simplify.

## Organisation

Minimalism to me means organisation.

**Everything should have its place**. That means I can find things easily, and therefore avoid losing things. 

I systematically organise all of my physical and virtual spaces. This makes me **feel in control** and allows me to create **order from complexity**.

## Focus
Minimalism to me means focus.

I put my time, energy, and money into things I care about.

I focus on **one thing at a time**. E.g. I focus solely on perfecting my forehand before even thinking about my backhand. Some might say this is an inefficient way of doing things, but I find focus to be incredibly important when it comes to mastery.

## Design
Minimalism to me means design.

When I'm designing anything, I aim for a  minimalist aesthetic.

I buy products that were made with minimalist design principles. This often
means that I buy from companies like Apple, or Muji.

Minimalism isn’t for everyone.

It doesn't solve all my problems.

But I couldn't live without it.
