<!-- Inner conflicts -->

A few months ago, I read a book that changed the whole way I think about life. The book is called *"Nonviolent Communication"* by Marshall Rosenburg, and it was recommended to me by my therapist shortly after we began  working together. Having read a few self-help books before, I was doubtful that this book would have a life-changing impact on me. However, Nonviolent Communication presents such a radically different way of thinking about ourselves and others than we have been educated to think—not just by our parents and teachers—but by our society and common *'wisdom'* as a whole.

Nonviolent Communication helped me realise that lots of our inner conflicts comes from the way in which we've been educated to think about ourselves and others. We've been educated to think about ourselves in terms of *what we are*, using a type of life alienating communication called "moralistic judgements". This kind of communication is rich with words that classify and label people and their actions, e.g., "I am clever", "I am stupid", "I am selfish", etc. Unfortunately, this kind of thinking can often lead to depression; I know this all too well.

Nonviolent Communication, as opposed to these "violent" moralistic judgements, educates us to think about ourselves and others in terms of our fundamental *feelings and needs*. In fact, once you get used to this compassionate kind of thinking, it is never necessary to judge anyone for anything (more on this later). 

<!-- Behind depression are powerful messages that are telling us what needs of ours are not getting met by our present situation.  -->

It is important to define exactly what is meant by feelings and needs. Feelings are emotions *free of thought*. E.g., "I feel that I was treated unfairly" is *not a feeling*; it is an *evaluation* because the word "feel" could be replaced by "think". So is *"I feel inadequate/misunderstood/ignored..."* because the word "feel" in these sentences could be replaced by "I think I am..."; thus, these are not feelings, they are evaluations based on moralistic judgements. Feelings are universally understood, and represent fundamental human emotions, e.g., *sadness, joy, frustration, hurt, and gladness* are all feelings because they exist free from thought. Our feelings are reactions to our *needs*: these are fundamental and universal human needs, e.g., "I need to score 100% on my next assignment" is not a need but instead a strategy to meet a need (perhaps in this case achievement). It is important to distinguish between strategies to get our needs met, and the needs themselves. There are multiple ways to get our needs met, and some are more effective than others. Getting clear exactly on what our needs are can often help us find a strategy that will maximise the chance that we will get that need met. Examples of needs are *love, attention, connection, and safety*, and human beings all have these same needs. 

All human behaviour is in service of our needs. Even violent behaviour is driven by powerful needs, such as attention, recognition, or even respect. When we lose touch with our needs, the likelihood that we will pursue strategies such as violence increases. We can also behave violently towards ourselves, e.g., by means of self-blame or criticism: "I'm a failure", "I'm a bad student", etc. 

Getting in touch with our needs requires listening to ourselves, first to understand and affirm how we are feeling, and then what we are needing. 

If depression is a dark cave, you can escape that cave by listening to your needs and trying to find the most effective strategies to get those needs met. E.g., you might be depressed because you feel lonely. Behind this feeling could be a need for connection, or it could be a need for love. Finding the need is important because once we know what our needs are, we can often more easily find a way to get them met.
