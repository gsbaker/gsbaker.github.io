title: "Investigating Conformity in Online Behaviour"
---

## 1. Introduction 

This article serves as a summary of the final year research project that I completed as part of my computer science 
degree. There are many areas of computer science that I could have chosen to explore, e.g., Artificial 
Intelligence, Security, Networks, or Theoretical Computer Science. However, having long been interested in the relationship 
between humans and technology, I chose the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). As our relationship with 
technology has become more complex following the rise of the internet and mobile devices, the need for research into
our behaviour with these systems has increased. One of these areas is user-user interaction, i.e., the study 
of social behaviour online. An unresolved question is whether the same social influences which affect people in 
face-to-face (f-t-f) groups also apply (and produce the same behaviour) in online environments. One of these social 
influences, which I explored in this research, is conformity to group pressure.

Conformity is a social phenomenon in which people change their opinions in order to agree with an opposing majority. Research
into this phenomenon began with Asch's famous 
[line-judgement experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) in the 1950s, summarised as follows:

> A group of eight gathered in what appeared to be a simple experiment in visual discrimination. This group were instructed
> to match the length of a given line—the standard—with one of three other lines. One of the three comparison lines was
> equal to the standard; the other two lengths differed from the standard by considerable amounts.
> The participants announced their judgements publicly. All but one of the participants had met with the experimenter 
> beforehand and were instructed to respond on certain trials with unanimous and incorrect judgements.

## 2. Method

To extend Asch's experiment to an online environment, I developed and deployed an online quiz with multiple choice
questions of an objective nature. Each question presented four lines and asked "Which is the tallest line?". In order
to introduce some element of group pressure, the question also presented some fictitious data—titled "How others 
answered"—which aimed to represent how previous (fake) participants had answered the question. Mirroring Asch's original
experiment, on some questions this data indicated that a majority of previous participants had answered incorrectly.
