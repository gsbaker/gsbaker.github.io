**It doesn’t matter if it’s not on the test**

There once was a little girl who very much enjoyed to learn. She found the world a place filled with wonder and mysteries to discover. At first, school was a magnificent place; eager for knowledge and driven by curiosity, the girl thrived in an environment facilitated by skilled educators. 

But then, the girl turned eleven, and suddenly the government got involved. 

Although the little girl might not like it, of course, every rational adult agrees that there *‘needs to be standardised tests so we can accurately compare the results of schools and children and eventually use that data to stream children into different ability groups so the adults can extract the highest potential grades at GCSE level’*. 

And of course, *‘we absolutely need economic growth, and therefore, we must heavily encourage our children into STEM subjects at the very earliest age; after all, they’ll earn more that way, and we’ll be able to collect higher taxes’*…

But for the little girl, suddenly that joy of learning was slowly being replaced. Now she was being told—by her peers and the adults—*’it doesn’t matter if it’s not on the test!’*.

Suddenly, learning—for its own sake—didn’t seem so fun anymore. 

Suddenly, it was all about the test—it would decide everything—success could mean big paycheques; failure could mean years of shame and uncertainty. 

Everyone seemed in on the game: her peers, her parents, her teachers…

Suddenly, school became serious. Suddenly, learning for its own sake didn’t matter. Suddenly, it was about the grades…

**Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation**

Even if we instinctively know that grades take the fun out of learning, what may be less clear is *why?*

The answer lies in two different types of motivation: on the one hand, there’s intrinsic motivation—that would be learning *for its own sake*—on the other hand, there’s extrinsic motivation—that would be learning as a *means to an end*—grades are what we call an *extrinsic motivator.*

Decades of research has shown that extrinsic motivators are effective in the short term, but ineffective in the long term. E.g., a fear of punishment may motivate us to do a piece of homework which we don’t find interesting, however, once that fear is removed, we are unlikely to do a task which we don’t find valuable *in and of itself*.

Here are some of the damaging consequences caused by the extrinsic nature of grades:

1. *Undermining the intrinsic value of learning for its own sake.* When students are motivated by an extrinsic motivation to get higher grades, this undermines intrinsic motivation: a desire to learn for its own sake. In other words, when we grade students, they are likely to focus on learning as a *‘means to an end’*, rather than something of intrinsic value.
2. *Creating a preference for the easiest possible task*: grading students sends the message that success is more important than learning. Therefore, with the danger of a low grade hanging over them, students are much less likely to take any risks, explore their intellectual curiosities, or do anything beyond what is required to achieve the reward of a high grade.

Conversely, intrinsic motivation—a desire to learn for its own sake—is a much more powerful form of motivation. When we are motivated to learn, simply because the act of doing so is valuable to us—without the distraction of a grade—we are likely to learn far more, follow our curiosities, and take risks with our explorations.

**The ‘token’ economy: how economics hijacks the true purpose of the education system**

Given that we intuitively know that grades take the fun out of learning, and the research about intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation shows us that intrinsic motivation is much more powerful, why is the entire education system set up to destroy the intrinsic value of learning in favour of the reward based nature of tests and grades?

This, I believe, gets to the core of the issue: *what is the purpose of school?*

On the one hand, here’s how I would answer that question:

- Help children grow into responsible adults, whilst accepting that ultimately, they need to find their own path and make their own choices;
- Impart critical thinking skills upon the next generation, so that they’ll be more likely to question dangerous ideologies and unhealthy ideas;
- Empower children to follow their interests and talents, supporting them along that journey.

On the other hand, this is how I believe most people would answer that question:

- Ultimately, school is about earning potential: children need to be put into a position where they can be financially successful, and in doing so, aid in economic growth;
- GCSEs and A Levels are a ticket to university, which is itself a ticket to success in adulthood; school is just about teaching children how to ‘play the system’, even if what they have to do to get there isn’t valuable *in and of itself*.

Education policy is really about economics, not learning. My evidence for this is the absurd focus on STEM—that’s science, technology, engineering, and maths—which are all of course very valuable subjects. However, if school was really about learning, then would these subjects be placed so conspicuously above the arts, philosophy, history, literature, etc.?

Grades are part of what we call the *‘token economy’*, which is full of extrinsic motivators: ‘*do this and you’ll get that’.* Study for this test, and you’ll get a good grade—there’s your token—which you can trade for a place at a university. Do this university course and you can trade your certificate for a lucrative career. Do this lucrative career—even if it’s mind-numbingly dull—and you’ll get a huge paycheque every month. So on, and so on. 

School is simply the first stone in the wider incentive structure: *‘do this and you’ll get that’*.

**Are grades a measure of success?**

**Autonomy, choice, and children: why we control rather than facilitate**

Running a classroom in which the teacher is responsible for following the children’s interests, and where children are given real choice and autonomy in what they learn, whilst also teaching the children how to become responsible people is very difficult.

Perhaps that’s why it’s so much easier to have a reward based curriculum which doesn’t change, is easy to teach, and which teachers don’t need to change or adapt much year-on-year.

And when it comes to behaviour, we of course expect unquestioning compliance and obedience from our students. However, what lesson does that teach them in the long run? Does it teach them to think critically—or for themselves—about what they’re doing and why? 

Or is that an inconvenience for the teacher who is so used to a system in which educating is not the primary concern; rather, a system of control, manipulation and reward.

- Unquestioning compliance and obedience
- Convenient for adults
