*"Curiositas Est Scientia"* - Curiosity is Knowledge. I have always been curious. I have a story to back this up. In one
of my first visits to Llandudno as a child (I must have been three or four) I was watching a performance of Punch and Judy
on the promenade (which is still going to this day). I saw a talking puppet—*Mr Punch*—appear out of the top of a rectangular 
box, similar in size to a phone box. I wasn't having any of it; I had to figure out how this puppet had been conjured and
who was manufacturing its whiny voice. Therefore, I ran up to the box, whilst all the other children were sitting captivated,
and banged my fist; surely *someone* or *something* was inside... what can I say, I'm curious!

This same curiosity led me to start *Curious George*, named of course after the fictional monkey of the same title.
I am interested about many things, from politics to men's fashion. I am always seeking *the big picture*. This is (I 
hope) reflected in my writings; I want to write about many things, and I want to zoom out and consider *how is this
significant?* I.e., I want to provide you—*the reader*—with the conclusions of my curiosity. 

As well as being curious, I love creativity and problem solving; often, these three things go hand in hand. I think this
is what led me to become a software engineer. Due to my occupation, I am constantly asking two questions  *what if?* and
*why not?*; I believe that applying these to daily-life has driven—and will drive—human innovation. So *why not* start 
a blog?
