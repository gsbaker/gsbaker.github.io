My name is **George Baker**, and _gsbaker_ is the username I use on the web. I come from
[Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham) in the United Kingdom, and I'm a
software engineer for [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh)-based
award-winning accounting software company [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com).

#### Education

After completing my [A Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Level) in Mathematics, Computer Science, and French, I gained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the [University of Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham). My undergraduate research was about conformity in online behaviour, based on the famous [Asch
experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments).

I also studied and passed the [ABRSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABRSM) Grade 5 Piano
exam.

#### Motto
---

_"Curiositas Est Scientia"_ - Curiosity is Knowledge.

I am interested about many things; I am always seeking *the big picture*. This is (I
hope) reflected in my writing. I want to zoom out and consider *how is this
significant?* I.e., I want to provide you—*the reader*—with the conclusions of my curiosity.

#### Favourites
---

- **Novel:** [Pride and Prejudice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice)
- **Album:** [In Rainbows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Rainbows)
- **Film:** [The Godfather Part II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II)
- **Programming Language:** [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))

#### Monogram

<img src="/img/monogram_beige_bg.jpeg" alt="George Baker's Monogram" class="w-25">

- The letters use _"Apple Garmond"_, one of my favourite typefaces.
- The dragon represents the [legend of Saint George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon) and [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), a country which has special meaning to me.
- The leaves represent nature, peace, and beauty, signifying my dislike of conflict.
