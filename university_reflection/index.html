      <h1>Reflecting on my University Experience</h1>
    </header>

    <div>
      <p>A few weeks ago, in a somewhat grand ceremony, I officially graduated from the University of Birmingham with a BSc in
Computer Science. Not an easy feat in the best of times, however, the past three years really weren‚Äôt the best of times. My <em>‚Äòuniversity
experience‚Äô</em> was split in half by a global pandemic which caused three national lockdowns. The consequences for university
students like me: societies, sports teams, face-to-face lectures, and supposedly some of our greatest years, all gone‚Ä¶</p>

<p>After struggling to find people who shared my interests at secondary school, I was relishing the opportunity to make lifelong
friends and develop myself at university. When I arrived, the Guild of Students provided over 300 societies to fuel
any niche (including a Tea Society), giving me the chance to pursue photography (a hobby I continue to enjoy to this day).</p>

<p>The infamous first week after moving in‚Äî<em>‚Äòfreshers week‚Äô</em>‚Äî was extremely hyped up by both the university and the Guild;
so much so that I purchased their ¬£75 ticket for five <em>‚Äòofficial‚Äô</em> events, of which I went to <em>one</em>, and later regretted.
I met hundreds (maybe thousands) of people in freshers week, and the vast majority of those people I never saw again.</p>

<p>Although I went to university in my home city, I decided to move into halls rather than live at home; this proved a wise
decision. Even though my flat didn‚Äôt gel (none of us kept in touch or stayed living together), the independence I gained
from living away from my parents and close to other students enabled me to gain key life skills and confidence.</p>

<p>As it turned out, all the close friendships I made were with fellow computer science students: perhaps this is because of our shared love
of technology, or just the fact that we worked on <em>many</em> assignments together.</p>

<p>I also found that even though I didn‚Äôt drink at all, nobody really cared. In fact, it enabled me to experience things
<em>as they were</em> without any filter; it turns out, a lot of the ridiculous alcohol culture and <em>‚Äòinitiation ceremonies‚Äô</em>
are either boring or seriously questionable.</p>

<p>After completing the first semester, I was really starting to settle in to university life. However, in March 2020‚Äîsix
months after I had started‚Äîcoronavirus sent the world into lockdown. Even when it became apparent that the UK would experience an outbreak, I naively thought that we‚Äôd all lock
ourselves at home for a couple of weeks and then the scare would be over. Evidently, I didn‚Äôt expect it
would last for two years when I packed just one month‚Äôs worth of clothes to take back home with me during my <em>‚Äòescape‚Äô</em>.</p>

<p>It feels wrong to say, but I‚Äôll admit that I was quite excited during the first lockdown: at last, I get to personally
experience a major world event. I remember that overnight, the international students‚Äîespecially those from China‚Äîdisappeared.
Clearly their families had told them how bad things really were. At first, I was relishing the <em>‚Äòbenefits‚Äô</em>: no exams! I can stay at home
and watch TV all I want! In fact, all I had to do to pass my first year was to spend an afternoon creating a simple
blog app.</p>

<p>The novelty quickly wore off‚Ä¶ I can safely say that the second lockdown‚Äîduring my second year‚Äîwas
the worst period of my life. Here I was supposed to be having the best years of my life, stuck inside four walls that quickly
felt like a prison. I went through a major depression feeling like my life was being stolen away from me. On the flip side,
this period was also the catalyst for some major life changes: I ditched relationships that weren‚Äôt working and went
into therapy, perhaps the best decision of my life. This enabled me to use my third year‚Äîwhen things went back to
<em>‚Äònormal‚Äô</em>‚Äîto explore myself and fully experience <em>‚Äòuniversity life‚Äô</em>.</p>

<p>During my third and final year, I threw myself into new things: tennis, photography, even karate. The misery of lockdown
prompted me to make sure that I <em>absolutely made the most</em> of the short rest of my time at university. I learnt not to be held
back by what other people might think and to prioritise my own needs. I started dating, and I now have
a wonderful girlfriend.</p>

<p>Academically, I was challenged, pushed to do my best work, and rewarded at the end with a 2:1 (after inadvertently picking
some of the most difficult third year modules). I learnt that AI is just probability, that nobody knows if P=NP, and
how to write <em>‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù</em> in about ten different programming languages. I realised that computer science students
are <em>mostly</em> normal and also incredibly smart.</p>

<p>During my final year project, I even conducted my own research
into conformity on social media, and if you really want to, you can read my dissertation <del>here</del> (no longer available).
(though I‚Äôm not sure why you would).</p>

<p>I started university as a shy and anxious teenage boy, and I‚Äôm leaving a confident young adult ready for the next
challenge. Having my university experience disrupted by the pandemic made it even more of a challenge; however, my
cohort and I got through it and showed incredible resilience in the hope that some day, life would be back to normal.
And when it did, I can safely say that I made the most of my final year, getting involved with sports clubs and
societies, and going to (just a few) parties! I‚Äôll never forget the university, the people I met, and the journey I went
through. Whatever is next, I‚Äôm now ready for it!</p>
