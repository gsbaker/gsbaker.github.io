A few weeks ago, in a somewhat grand ceremony, I officially graduated from the University of Birmingham with a BSc in
Computer Science. Not an easy feat in the best of times, however, the past three years really weren't the best of times. My *'university 
experience'* was split in half by a global pandemic which caused three national lockdowns. The consequences for university
students like me: societies, sports teams, face-to-face lectures, and supposedly some of our greatest years, all gone...

After struggling to find people who shared my interests at secondary school, I was relishing the opportunity to make lifelong
friends and develop myself at university. When I arrived, the Guild of Students provided over 300 societies to fuel
any niche (including a Tea Society), giving me the chance to pursue photography (a hobby I continue to enjoy to this day).

The infamous first week after moving in—*'freshers week'*— was extremely hyped up by both the university and the Guild;
so much so that I purchased their £75 ticket for five *'official'* events, of which I went to *one*, and later regretted.
I met hundreds (maybe thousands) of people in freshers week, and the vast majority of those people I never saw again.

Although I went to university in my home city, I decided to move into halls rather than live at home; this proved a wise
decision. Even though my flat didn't gel (none of us kept in touch or stayed living together), the independence I gained
from living away from my parents and close to other students enabled me to gain key life skills and confidence. 

As it turned out, all the close friendships I made were with fellow computer science students: perhaps this is because of our shared love
of technology, or just the fact that we worked on *many* assignments together. 

I also found that even though I didn't drink at all, nobody really cared. In fact, it enabled me to experience things
*as they were* without any filter; it turns out, a lot of the ridiculous alcohol culture and *'initiation ceremonies'*
are either boring or seriously questionable. 

After completing the first semester, I was really starting to settle in to university life. However, in March 2020—six 
months after I had started—coronavirus sent the world into lockdown. Even when it became apparent that the UK would experience an outbreak, I naively thought that we'd all lock
ourselves at home for a couple of weeks and then the scare would be over. Evidently, I didn't expect it
would last for two years when I packed just one month's worth of clothes to take back home with me during my *'escape'*.

It feels wrong to say, but I'll admit that I was quite excited during the first lockdown: at last, I get to personally
experience a major world event. I remember that overnight, the international students—especially those from China—disappeared.
Clearly their families had told them how bad things really were. At first, I was relishing the *'benefits'*: no exams! I can stay at home
and watch TV all I want! In fact, all I had to do to pass my first year was to spend an afternoon creating a simple
blog app. 

The novelty quickly wore off... I can safely say that the second lockdown—during my second year—was
the worst period of my life. Here I was supposed to be having the best years of my life, stuck inside four walls that quickly
felt like a prison. I went through a major depression feeling like my life was being stolen away from me. On the flip side, 
this period was also the catalyst for some major life changes: I ditched relationships that weren't working and went
into therapy, perhaps the best decision of my life. This enabled me to use my third year—when things went back to 
*'normal'*—to explore myself and fully experience *'university life'*.

During my third and final year, I threw myself into new things: tennis, photography, even karate. The misery of lockdown 
prompted me to make sure that I *absolutely made the most* of the short rest of my time at university. I learnt not to be held
back by what other people might think and to prioritise my own needs. I started dating, and I now have
a wonderful girlfriend. 

Academically, I was challenged, pushed to do my best work, and rewarded at the end with a 2:1 (after inadvertently picking
some of the most difficult third year modules). I learnt that AI is just probability, that nobody knows if P=NP, and
how to write *"Hello, World!"* in about ten different programming languages. I realised that computer science students 
are *mostly* normal and also incredibly smart. 

During my final year project, I even conducted my own research 
into conformity on social media, and if you really want to, you can read my dissertation [here](/files/conformity-online-report.pdf)
(though I'm not sure why you would).

I started university as a shy and anxious teenage boy, and I'm leaving a confident young adult ready for the next
challenge. Having my university experience disrupted by the pandemic made it even more of a challenge; however, my
cohort and I got through it and showed incredible resilience in the hope that some day, life would be back to normal.
And when it did, I can safely say that I made the most of my final year, getting involved with sports clubs and 
societies, and going to (just a few) parties! I'll never forget the university, the people I met, and the journey I went
through. Whatever is next, I'm now ready for it!
