Before I entered therapy, I held what I think is a common set of intuitions and beliefs about depression. Namely, 
that *depression is the opposite of happiness*—and the goal of life, of course, is to be constantly happy. However, 
after reading the work of people like [Dr Marshall Rosenberg](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com) and
[Alice Miller](https://www.alice-miller.com/en/home/), I now offer you, the reader, my new perspective on depression.

It is common—at some point in time—for a depressed person (we’ll call him Bob) to think something along the lines 
of: *“I cannot live with myself any more”*. However, whilst Bob has made an inner plea for change, he does not
realise that there is a hidden truth behind this statement inaccessible to him in his current state: the *“I”* cannot 
live with the mysterious *“my-self”*. It is the **“self”** that is an important realisation. I believe that depressed
peoples are not connected to their *true selves*<sup>1</sup>. They have developed a *false self* such that they cannot 
experience the range of human emotions that make life wonderful.

The false self is most likely a product of childhood trauma<sup>2</sup>. Betty learns during childhood that her parents expect her
to go to university, and ideally become a doctor. She learns to repress and ‘bury’ her own true feelings because they 
are unacceptable to her parents—thus creating her false self.

Her false self lives life to first satisfy her parents needs, then to satisfy other people—she is constantly looking
for approval and is depressed, anxious, and feels ‘empty’. This is because she is disconnected from her true
feelings and needs. She does not feel grateful when her friends throw her a surprise party. She does not feel sad 
at a funeral. She has learnt to repress her feelings for her own protection from an early age.

The true self is allowed to develop **autonomously**. That is, their life is a product of true deep wishes rather 
than an adaptation to someone else’s—i.e., their parent’s—vision. The true self is allowed to acknowledge and express
their own intense feelings.

It is possible (through therapy) to acquaint your true self, thus shredding the dependence on the false self. 
The true self is authentic and powerful—and I’m glad that I met mine.
