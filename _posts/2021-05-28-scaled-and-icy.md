Twenty One Pilots are an interesting band. They’re achieved massive mainstream popularity thanks to singles like Stressed Out, Ride, and Heathens. However, beneath the surface of these easy listening, mediocre hits, are a very unique, ambitious, and exciting duo with an **extremely** [loyal fanbase](https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/).

After the sudden fame and success of their fourth album Blurryface (thanks to the aforementioned singles), it must have been difficult for singer and songwriter Tyler Joseph to know what to do next. How do you build on sudden popularity after existing for so long as a notable, but fairly obscure artist?

The answer he came up with was to dive deeper into the Blurryface (an embodiment of Tyler's insecurities) concept, and make an album for their fans. And so was born their fifth album Trench. Tyler even sings on that album that he doesn’t “believe the hype” of their previous album. And this was a very wise decision, because Trench is (still) their best album by far. It was rich, bold, and ambitious — both musically and lyrically.

Trench is a concept album that created the fictional city of Dema, ruled by nine evil bishops. An insurrectionary group called the “Banditos” resist this tyranny, and it’s all apparently a huge metaphor for Joseph’s inner mental struggles. On the song titled ‘Bandito’, Tyler sings “I created this world (Dema) to feel some control… destroy it if I want”. Well, that world has been well and truly destroyed on this, their sixth album.

You’d think that an album written at a time of global misery and suffering would be very dark and isolated — especially one made by Twenty One Pilots. However, despite the title of the album being a play on “scaled back and isolated”, and also an anagram for “[Clancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwVgm4gEbLg) is dead”, Tyler wanted to avoid digging into the current nightmare.

> The idea of adding to the pressure of what's going on in our world, it didn't feel right. It felt like I needed to go the opposite direction, I wanted to escape a little bit more and provide people with that opportunity to escape too.

Whereas Trench was introspective and atmospheric, Scaled and Icy begins on an extremely positive note (literally) with the opening track Good Day. It’s very vibrant and upbeat — something Tyler admits is “different from any first song [he’s] ever done”. Tyler begins the song by singing “I can feel my saturation leaving me slowly”. The problem is that this album is perhaps a little oversaturated.

When I heard ‘Shy Away’, the first single released for this album, it would be an understatement to say that I was extremely disappointed. In sharp contrast to their previous album, Shy Away is surface level, dull, and bland. It honestly sounds like it could’ve been created by an algorithm. The song just screams ‘meh’. Thankfully, it turned out to be the worst song on the record.

Good Day, Saturday, and Mulberry Street are all fun, bright, and cheerful — at least musically. Lyrically, Good Day is a very depressing song about losing your job, spouse, and child…

> Lost my job, my wife and child… homie just sued me

Saturday has a light and breezy vibe, but when you take a closer look at the lyrics, it’s very timely:

> Lose my sense a time or two… Weeks feel like days

Sound relatable? Ahem, lockdown…

Overall, this characterises Scaled And Icy: very upbeat on the surface — almost like a medicine for the terrible state of the world at the moment. When you dig deeper at the lyrics however, you often find that it’s more serious.

The best songs by far on this album are No Chances and Redecorate. That’s because they’re both Twenty One Pilots at their best: a bold, exciting, and rich sound characterised by precise, heavy beats. Redecorate is definitely the most powerful track and it does a great job of closing the album. Lyrically, it’s about considering whether to redecorate the room of a child who passed away:

> I don't want to go on like this
> At least let me clean my room
> I don't want to leave like this
> 'Cause the last thing I want to do is
> Make my people make decisions
> Wondering what to do, oh
> Should they keep it on display
> Or redecorate?

Despite these great moments however, Scaled And Icy is definitely not Twenty One Pilot’s finest work. It’s sprinkled with mediocre songs like Shy Away, The Outside, Formidable, and Bounce Man. Honestly, I expected better. And therefore, I’m giving this album three stars.

I still think that it’s worth a listen, but be warned: if you were a big fan of the musical direction of Trench, I think it’s likely you’ll be disappointed by this.
