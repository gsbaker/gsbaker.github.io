Californian Soil is very much about **taking back control**. With that control, lead singer Hannah Reid delivers a subtle pushback against the misogyny she’s faced as a front woman in a toxic music industry.

> This record is about gaining possession of my own life. You imagine success will be amazing. Then you see it from the inside and ask, 'Why am I not controlling this thing?’

London Grammar describe their third album as ‘highly personal’. Whilst it’s **musically similar to their previous albums**, this project sees Reid taking control of the album’s message after she describes being ‘too polite to each other’ over the creation process in the past.

In fact, unlike their previous two albums whose covers featured all three band members (Hannah Reid, Dot Major and Dan Rothman) it’s only Reid who’s on the album art this time around.

Californian Soil is a definite **criticism of the sexism Reid has experienced in the music industry**, demonstrated by powerful feminist tropes throughout the album’s lyrics.

> I saw the way you made her feel like she should be somebody else… I saw the way you laughed behind her back when you bleeped somebody else

> There is a whisper that our god is a she


Even to me, a man who doesn’t work in the music industry, it feels relatable. And now I’m angry…

There are some great songs on Californian Soil. **Lose Your Head is for me the album’s standout track**. It’s catchy, has plenty of swagger, and I could gladly sing along to it all day! Other highlights include Lord It’s a Feeling, Baby It’s You and Call Your Friends which are all dreamy and soothing. I also have a feeling that How Does It Feel will be a hit when the clubs reopen (hopefully soon!).

Overall, the **songs are all catchy, dreamy, and have beautifully delivered vocals** thanks to Reid’s contralto.

One key musical addition on this album is the use of strings, which the band describe as ‘one of the most emotive parts in music’. In fact, the opening track is all strings, and the melody was apparently in Reid’s head ‘about four years ago’… Reid described hearing the strings being played back as ‘surreal’.

Other than that, I would say that London Grammar are **at risk of becoming a little too formulaic**. Sonically, their sound hasn’t evolved that much since their first album. Personally, **I would have liked to see them be bolder and experiment more** with their sound as well as their message.

The album seems to have been received very well by listeners; they’ve got themselves in the charts, on mainstream radio, and managed to sell out their tour in less than a few days (I tried and failed to get tickets).

I can’t help but wonder if this is because of their newfound confidence in speaking up about sexism in the music industry, or because of their easy-to-listen sound that tends to do well in the charts.

After being undermined by engineers at soundcheck, ignored by producers in her own studio sessions, and [not let into her own gig](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/london-grammar-interview-hannah-reid-album-b1832062.html), I would say that Californian Soil is a triumphant ‘FU’ to the casual misogyny of the music industry (and society in general). However, although I did enjoy the album a lot, I would love to see London Grammar go even further with their sound.
