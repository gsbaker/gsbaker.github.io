title: Things I’ve learnt from using dating apps

Since the national lockdown restrictions are finally being lifted, dating in person is now somewhat possible again. Therefore, **I decided to sign up for three of the most popular dating apps** to help me meet the girl of my dreams: Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge.

Here’s what I’ve learnt from using these services over the past few weeks:

## 1. Be yourself

There’s a great opening lyric from the song [Supersonic by Oasis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJKpUH2kJQg): 
> I need to be myself… I can’t be no one else

My goal when I joined the online dating world was to find someone who I could actually have a serious relationship with. 

I think the easiest way to do that is to **be yourself**, and eventually you’ll find someone who **genuinely likes the real you**.

If you try and copy what other people are doing, or use some horrible pick up line you heard about in a YouTube video, you might find more ‘success’. I.e. you’ll get more matches and maybe some short term flings.  

But I would argue that real success on these apps is **finding someone you’re actually compatible with irl**. 

## 2. What would I think if I received this message?

A good friend of mine gave me this piece of advice which really helps you avoid sending a creepy, boring, or unfunny message. 

The chances are that if you would be ok with, or even better *like* to receive the message you’re about to send, then the likelihood is **it’s a good message**. At the very least, it’s not a bad message. 

If you follow this advice and they don’t react well, or put any effort into a response, then chances are you’re not on the same wavelength. I.e. incompatible. 

## 3. Most advice doesn’t work

There’s a lot of conflicting and also bad Tinder advice online. Think YouTube, Reddit, and online articles from so called ‘experts’. 

The problem is that what some people think is a good message because it suits their personality and style, might not be **real** coming from you. 

That doesn’t mean you can go and be boring af because some of the advice is generally useful like choosing photos that showcase your personality, and making plans to meet up irl rather than dragging the digital conversation on. 

## 4. Move towards a date, or un-match to avoid leading them on

It sometimes helps to think of Tinder like a game; not in a _‘try and get in as many girls’ pants as possible’_  kind of way, but in a _‘moving towards a goal’_ kind of way. I.e. begin with the end in mind. 

Everything you do should be to move yourself closer towards being able to ask her out, and if she isn’t showing any enthusiasm for you, or you don’t like the vibe she’s giving off, it’s time to un-match and move on. 

## 5. Pick up lines might work, but avoid using them

The problem I have with pick up lines is although they might show your witty or funny side, these are superficial traits. **Generic pick up lines aren’t genuine**. 

In my opinion, it’s much better to showcase that you’re a genuine person specifically interested in her, and a generic pick up line just doesn’t demonstrate that. 

They’re also what every guy uses, and so using the second thing I learnt (what would I think if I received this message), I might think _‘this guy is boring because he can’t come up with something original to say to me, that relates to me…’ _

## 6. Things that I dislike about girls’ dating profiles

Finally, I’ve learnt that some girls’ profiles really turn me off, for the following reasons:

### Smoking

**This is a major red flag for me**. 

If someone labels themselves a smoker given all of the evidence that it’s one of the worst things that you can do for your health, then I infer several things:
* they don’t care about their own health
* they’re irresponsible
* they lack self-discipline
* they don’t listen to good advice

All very bad signs that lead to an instant swipe left…

### Their bio is just them plugging their Instagram

This is so irritating. 

Doing this communicates a lot about you: 
* you can’t be bothered to write a decent bio (why is that? Are you too boring?)
* you care about gaining Instagram followers (why is that? Are you vain?)
* you’re willing to use the fact that boys will follow you for your looks to gain followers (would a genuine, well grounded person do that?) 

### No bio

If you’re too shy to write a bio then fair enough. I’d encourage you to write one anyway, but it’s not these people I’m talking about.

It’s the girls who clearly think they’re attractive enough not to need a bio. If you’re only relying on your looks to get my attention, then I would infer that you might not have an interesting personality or hobbies. 

### Must be 6’ rugby player

There’s nothing wrong with being attracted to tall, handsome guys. But this says a lot about your personality. And not in a good way.

### Tories swipe left

Slow down, I’m not saying that *I’m a tory* so this offends me... but **choosing this as your bio is aggressive and negative** (I want your bio to be positive and learn something unique about you) and communicates a lack of openness to different points of view (something which I’m not looking for). 

I would also infer that you would make politics a big part of our relationship but not in a good ‘let’s change the world for the better’ kind of way. This isn’t what I’m looking for. 


### Anything involving astrology

Any *belief* in this pseudoscientific bulls**t tells me you lack critical thinking skills. What if we were to have kids together? Would you raise them based on other baseless theories? No thanks. 

### I could drink you under the table

There’s nothing wrong with liking a bit of alcohol. But this makes me question: 
* is our relationship going to be based on alcohol? 
* are you superficial? 
* do you need alcohol to be interesting?

### I am *not* interested in drama 

Why do you feel the need to say this? 

In my experience, people who are ‘drama free’ are quite the opposite. They actually love drama and feed of it. 

If you were a socially competent person, **you would be able to deal with drama successfully**. 

If you feel the need to explicitly state in your profile that you don’t want drama, then maybe you lack the skills to deal with it. Unattractive.

Now, I’m not saying that I know everything about dating apps. In fact, quite the opposite: I know almost nothing. 

The conclusion that I’ve come to is that beyond obvious advice, nobody knows what they’re talking about and so this blog post aims to be my realistic take.
