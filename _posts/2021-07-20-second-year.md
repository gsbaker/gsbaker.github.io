It’s been well over a year since I wrote [this post]({% post_url 2020-05-27-first-year %}) reflecting on the first year of my degree. Since then, we’ve continued to live under the toughest social restrictions ever imposed — and that has certainly impacted my second year at university. That means that, unfortunately, this year hasn’t been all that positive. There have been more difficult and challenging times during this period than in any other part of my life.

That’s not to say that lots of things didn’t go well however. Thanks to some very hard work, I managed to achieve a first in all but one of my modules — I count that as a great achievement, especially given the circumstances. I studied some pretty cool topics too — I really liked learning [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)) for example. Additionally, in second term, we had a team project where we developed a game from scratch, and I felt like I managed to make some really valuable contributions.

Outside of my actual degree course, there were a couple of great wins too. Firstly, I served as publicity officer on the [Computer Science Society](https://cssbham.com) committee. Although we weren’t able to run any in person events, we built a highly active Discord server which provided people with some much needed virtual interaction. I also joined the university’s tennis club and managed to improve considerably in the few weeks when it was able to run.

Sadly though, due to the very strict social restrictions, I faced several difficulties and challenges this year too. For example, in a degree such as computer science, where a heavy degree of problem solving is required, I believe that spontaneous collaboration is really important. However, because of the pandemic, all collaboration was forced (i.e. through video / voice calls). That meant that in the moments where I got stuck on an assignment, I couldn’t start a spontaneous discussion with several of my peers who just happened to be in the same room i.e. it was very difficult to benefit from the thinking of people that you wouldn’t otherwise interact with.

I found the main challenge of this year to be the absence of a healthy social life. In all honestly, I found large parts of my second year extremely isolating and there were times where I found it difficult to keep going. I think that the main thing I’m going to take away from this year is the vital nature of social interaction — which I’ve developed a newfound appreciation for.

When it comes to remote working, I think that MS Teams and Zoom are genuinely great tools — where would we have been without them?! However great the tools are though, it’s no substitute for being face to face with someone in the same room — and perhaps that’s the way it always should be.

In summary, and in all honesty, I hope a year like this never repeats again. But, I’m glad I made it through — it’s genuinely made me appreciate people and life a lot more. Here’s to a third year that will make up for the bad moments of this one!
