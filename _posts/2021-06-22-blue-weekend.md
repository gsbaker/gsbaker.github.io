Wolf Alice are no strangers to massive success. Having won the 2018 Mercury Prize for their masterpiece sophomore project ‘Visions Of a Life’, I found it hard to fathom how they could follow it up with something equal, let alone better.

After hearing ‘The Last Man on Earth’ — the lead single for this, their third album, I found myself wondering why I ever doubted them.

> Who are you to ask for anything else? … The thing you should be asking is for help

According to Wolf Alice’s front woman Ellie Rowsell, “each song [on Blue Weekend] represents its own story”. However, in a similar fashion to their other albums, the songs are often about “relationships with partners, friends and with oneself”.

When it came to the sound of the album, Wolf Alice wanted to go for something “cinematic”. They drafted in Arcade Fire and Coldplay producer Markus Dravs to help bring their “weird” ideas to life in a residential studio in locked-down Brussels.

> Our approach is to throw loads of stuff at the recordings, put loads of layers on and play with loads of sound, but I think we met in the middle really nicely.

The result is a sound that I would describe as more mature, but quintessentially still Wolf Alice (spoiler: that’s a very good thing).

In fact, Blue Weekend is Wolf Alice’s best album to date — making it another masterpiece. From the dreamy vocals and guitar effects on ‘Lipstick on the Glass’, to the swirling synths of ‘How Can I Make It OK?’, to the aggressive guitar riffs on ‘Smile’ and ‘Play the Greatest Hits’ (a song which will rip your head off), this album has ambition written all over it, and it’s surely a contender for 2021’s album of the year (and possibly a Grammy…).

If I had to pick a favourite song, it would be the sensual tribute to self-love ‘Feeling Myself’. With its slightly ominous synth, and ethereal combination of creepy vocals, guitar effects, and strings, this track takes Wolf Alice to new heights.

Blue Weekend also shows off the softer side of Wolf Alice, with ‘Safe From Heartbreak (if you never fall in love)’, ‘No Hard Feelings’ (a delicate ballad about parting ways amicably), and ‘The Beach II’ which ends the album in dreamy shoegaze land where we’re all drinking “liquid rose”.

> No hard feelings honey… And we both will take the win

From start to finish, you get the sense that Blue Weekend is big, and will surely place Wolf Alice’s marker as one of the greatest bands of this era (if it wasn’t firmly planted already). Another masterpiece from one of the best bands around.
