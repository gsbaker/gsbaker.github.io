Wolf Alice are no strangers to massive success. Having won the 2018 Mercury Prize for their masterpiece sophomore project ‘Visions Of a Life’, I found it hard to fathom how they could follow it up with something equal, let alone better.

After hearing ‘The Last Man on Earth’ — the lead single for this, their third album, I found myself wondering why I ever doubted them.

> Who are you to ask for anything else? … The thing you should be asking is for help

According to interviews, Wolf Alice wanted to make Blue Weekend sound “cinematic”. To achieve this, they drafted in Arcade Fire and Coldplay producer Markus Dravs to help bring their “weird” ideas to life in a residential studio in locked-down Brussels.

> Our approach is to throw loads of stuff at the recordings, put loads of layers on and play with loads of sound, but I think we met in the middle really nicely.

The result is a sound that I would describe as stunningly ambitious, and yet mature at the same time.

In fact, Blue Weekend is not only Wolf Alice’s best album to date, it’s also an instant album of the year contender (again). From the dreamy vocals and guitar effects on ‘Lipstick on the Glass’, to the swirling synths of ‘How Can I Make It OK?’, to the aggressive guitar riffs on ‘Smile’ and ‘Play the Greatest Hits’ (a song which will rip your head off), this album has greatness written all over it.

Wolf Alice even had some room to show off their softer side with the acoustic ‘Safe From Heartbreak (if you never fall in love)’, and the beautiful ballad ‘No Hard Feelings’ which is probably the best song Wolf Alice have ever written from a lyrical standpoint.

> And for everything that ends… Something else must begin… No hard feelings honey… And we both will take the win

If I had to pick a favourite song though, it would be the slightly weird tribute to self-love ‘Feeling Myself’. With its slightly ominous synth, and ethereal combination of creepy vocals, guitar effects, and strings, this track takes Wolf Alice to even greater heights — something I did not believe possible.

From start to finish, you get the sense that Blue Weekend is an instant classic, and will surely place Wolf Alice’s marker as one of the greatest bands of this era (if it wasn’t firmly planted already). Another masterpiece from one of the best bands around.
