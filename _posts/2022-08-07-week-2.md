* I write to you from my special place, the only where I can truly relax. 
* I have had an extremely busy couple of weeks, starting with a trip to London, followed by Edinburgh, and ending up
here. 
* It was my first time in Edinburgh, and I must say, it didn't exactly leave me impressed. I confess I didn't appreciate
the dull grey architecture, the tourist tat shops, and the conspicuous lack of atmosphere. 
* I was most impressed by the royal palace of Hollyrood, and the Royal Yacht Britannia. The grand interiors and impressive
architecture contrasted that of most of Edinburgh.
