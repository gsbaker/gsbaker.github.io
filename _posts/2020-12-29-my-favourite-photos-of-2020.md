2020 has been the first year that I've owned a proper camera. Specifically, a 
[Canon EOS 200D](https://store.canon.co.uk/canon-eos-200d-black-ef-s-18-55mm-f-3-5-5-6-iii-lens/2250C018/). 

Over the past year, photography has become even more of a hobby of mine as I've learnt
more about the world of cameras and lenses.

This post contains my favourite photographs that I've taken this year â€” my first ever
 collection of such kind:
