* As I write my first weekly note, I am sat listening to the end of In Rainbowsâ€”one of my favourite records. Whilst I'm
not documenting my life on Videotape, I hope that this is the start of something meaningful, at least to me!
* Speaking of Radiohead, I've been listening to Hail to the Thief a lot this week, and I'm really loving it! Not as 
good as their other records IMO, but still a worthwhile listen 19 years later.
* There was a [heatwave](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62217282) on Monday and Tuesday in which the UK experienced
40 degree temperatures for the first time! It was so hot that the only time I went outside was the morning (before 11)
and I slept downstairs on a camp bed.
* I've been still searching for junior software engineering jobs, and starting to feel deflated by the whole job search
thing. It feels like my life is on pause until I can get that break.
* In other news, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss made it to the final two candidates to be PM. I'm especially not impressed
by Truss; if she wins, I'm predicting a Labour landslide at the next election. I'm more reassured by Rishi Sunak who
seems more competent, however he is also extremely privileged, so I'm unsure if he's really that down-to-earth.
