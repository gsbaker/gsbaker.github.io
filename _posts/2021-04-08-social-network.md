## Not another one!
Yes, I know what you’re thinking: who needs another social network? Facebook launched 17 years ago, and since then Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, Tumblr, and many more.

All these social networks are great at connecting you with people, organisations, and content all around the world. Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are all like a town plaza, i.e. they’re all a digital public space where anyone can say anything and anyone can listen. In that sense, I like to refer to them as *public social networks*.

What I’d like to build is a very focussed, and very simple *private social network*.

## Privacy
This social network is going to *private*, and I want to explain a little what that means.

### No public content
Firstly, there will be **no public content**.

That means that

#### 1. There will be no public posts
   
This means that your posts will only be visible to your friends.

#### 2. There will be no public accounts
   
This means that companies and organisations won’t be able to create public profiles.

### _Optional_ targeted ads
> Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. That’s what it means. I’m an optimist, I believe people are smart. And some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data. - Steve Jobs

This social network will only collect your name, and email address. And it won’t share that data with anyone else.

I propose that the social network allows targeted advertising but explains at the start exactly what that means and the implication of privacy. The user is given a choice about whether they want targeted advertising. I.e. **the user is in control**.

## Design
I view social networks as a tool. And when it comes to tools, I think design is one of the most important things to consider.

I happen to have many problems with the design of Facebook and Instagram. They’re both very bloated. Packed with features like Facebook Gaming, Instagram Shopping, Reels, and stories.

I want to take the opposite approach and aim for as few features as possible.

This will enable a very minimal and clean design.

I propose to just use native UI elements on the iOS and Android apps. And for the web app, a very simple, well designed front-end.

## Mental health
Social networks are designed to be addictive. And, they’re designed to make you chase likes and engagement.

Having a more private social network will solve a lot of that.

But I propose going further by having no friend count on profiles (the user would have to manually count their friends if they really want to know),  and no likes (or other reactions) on posts. There will only be commenting (if the user enables it).
