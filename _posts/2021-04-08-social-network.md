title: The social network that I want to build

## Not another one!

Yes, **I know what you're thinking**: who needs another social network? Facebook
launched 17 years ago, and since then Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat,
Tumblr, and many more.

If there are so many social networks out there already, and they all
do pretty much the same thing — **connecting people**, then why do I want 
to build another one?

In a saturated industry, which social networking definitely is, I would argue
that there are two reasons for entry:

1. There's something wrong with the existing products.
2. There's a new idea that nobody else has thought of.

I want to launch a new social network based on reason 1.

## What's the problem?

So which social network has a problem? 

Answer: **Facebook** (sorry Mark).

That might not be surprising to you.

If you live under a rock, read all of this and it'll make sense why:

- [Facebook is full of bloatware](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/facebook-is-full-of-bloatware/)

This post is not meant to be a criticism of Facebook, rather it is an acknowledgement 
that currently, the social networking landscape is **dominated by one company** and its
values might not actually align to yours. 

I would like to propose a **different social network with a different approach**.

## Things to take into account

### 1. Privacy

The problem is that on social networks, we've come to expect that you share a lot of 
your personal information: DOB (and consequently age); relationship status; gender; 
interests; your friendship groups; your career. I could go on.

So how do you build a social network with privacy in mind?

I propose two things:

1. You ask **at the beginning** whether the user is okay with being tracked for 
advertising. If they aren't, show them un-targeted ads.

2. All information about the user is hidden to everyone outside their friends list.

### 2. Business model

Social media companies make money from running an advertising business. 

Consequently, **people expect to be able to access a social network and all its
features for free**.

I believe that if something is worth paying for, people will pay for it. And so they should.

But we have to accept that no other model is going to work now that people are used
to an advertisement model. **A subscription model is not going to work**.

## Simplicity 

I want to build a very **simple** social network. One where the **purpose is clear** and
the **focus is small**.

There are services like Twitter and Instagram where you can share content to pretty much
everyone with an account. I want to take a different approach: **small circles** i.e.
friends and family only.

There will be **no likes** or other 'reactions' on posts.

There will be **no groups**.

The content the user can share will be limited to **text, images, and video**.

The front-end application will have a **very minimalist design**.

The news feed won't have 'suggested' posts; it'll **just show posts from your friends list**,
and **ads will be unobtrusive**. 

Essentially, I want to make a social network reduced to the most simple elements, without
bloatware and pointless features.
