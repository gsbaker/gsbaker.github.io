**5. Paranoid Android**

Number one on [Rolling Stone's readers' poll](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/readers-poll-the-10-best-radiohead-songs-19659/) 
of the best Radiohead songs and rated by critics as one of the greatest songs of all time. This song is over six minutes long with four distinct sections, 
and when it punches, it definitely doesn't hold back. A classic. 

**4. Subterranean Homesick Alien**

> I show them the stars and the meaning of life. they shut me away...but I'll be alright.

Powerful lyrics. Incredibly precise and complex instrumentation. Feels celestial. Maybe my favourite song on Ok 
Computer...

**3. In Limbo**

> I'm lost at sea, don't bother me, I've lost my way

has to be up there with my all-time favourite Radiohead lyrics. Listening to this song is akin to an out-of-body experience.
The instrumentation is haunting. The lyrics are visceral: *"you're living in a fantasy world..."* Beside all that, the guitar on this song is just so good. 

**2. The National Anthem**

A bone-thumping repetitive bass-line pervades throughout. Develops into occasionally
bizarre jazz described as *"a brass band marching into a brick wall"* by one reviewer. Has the initial hallmarks of a rock song,
but turns into something much more unsettling. 

**1. Weird Fishes / Arpeggi**

My personal favourite Radiohead song. Still can't get over the mesmerizing guitar arpeggios, the tight drums, and the 
amazing climax. 

> And I, I'll hit the bo-oootom, hit the botoooommm and escape... escape...

This will stay in my head forever.
