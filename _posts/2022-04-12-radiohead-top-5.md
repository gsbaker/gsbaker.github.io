title: My Top Five Radiohead Songs

As a huge Radiohead fan, it was difficult to pick this list, since there are so many excellent tracks among their
discography. I therefore chose songs from what I consider to be their best three albums: OK Computer, Kid A, and In 
Rainbows (how original...).

## 5. Airbag (OK Computer)
 
> In an interstellar burst, I am back to save the universe 

Unlike a lot of the raw rock music coming out in the 90s, the opener to OK Computer is pristine and incredibly well 
produced. I particularly love the euphoric and cathartic energy of this song, and I think it's without a doubt the best
opening track in Radiohead's discography. The guitar solo starting at 2:18 is also one of my favourite Radiohead moments. 

## 4. Subterranean Homesick Alien (OK Computer)

> I show them the stars and the meaning of life. they shut me away...but I'll be alright.

What I love about this song is how celestial it feels. Although the instrumentation is complex, it's still 
accessible; especially compared to their later work in the 2000s. I am a huge fan of the intertwining guitar and synth
melodies starting at 1:50. This is perhaps my favourite OK Computer song.  

## 3. In Limbo

> I'm lost at sea, don't bother me, I've lost my way

That has to be one of my all-time favourite Radiohead lyrics: it's incredibly sad and depressing. Listening to this song is
akin to an out-of-body experience since the instrumentation is so haunting. The repeated refrain *"you're living in a
fantasy world..."* is so powerful. Beside all that, the guitar on this song is amazing. 

## 2. The National Anthem

A bone-thumping repetitive bass-line pervades throughout. Develops into occasionally
bizarre jazz described as *"a brass band marching into a brick wall"* by one reviewer. Has the initial hallmarks of a rock song,
but turns into something much more unsettling. I am a huge fan of the experimentation in this song; it's one of those tracks
that really pushes the boundaries, and turns music into something more like art. Truly breathtaking...

## 1. Weird Fishes / Arpeggi

My personal favourite Radiohead song. Still can't get over the mesmerizing guitar arpeggios, the tight drums, and the 
amazing climax. 

> And I, I'll hit the bo-oootom, hit the botoooommm and escape... escape...

This will stay in my head forever.
