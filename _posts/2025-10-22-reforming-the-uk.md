title: "Fixing the UK: the major changes we need to reverse
decades of decline"
author: George Baker

These proposed changes are controversial, and perhaps the population of the
UK—heavily influenced by a powerful right wing media—are not ready for such radical
reforms. However, I believe that if the UK is to succeed in the future, and
avoid complete collapse, bold and surgical changes are necessary, and each carries
significant long-term benefits.

- The House of Commons and House of Lords should be abolished.
- The UK government should be completely decentralised into three regional
  governments, each with its own Prime Minster: the English government, the
  Scottish government, and the Welsh government. These should all have total
  political autonomy.
- For the sake of pragmatism and contuinity, the monarchy should be retained,
  with the King being the symbolic head of the UK, whilst keeping each nation
  politically autonomous.
- There should remain a single currency, the Pound, however, the Bank of
  England should be renamed the Bank of the UK, and its headquarters should be
  moved to Manchester.
- The new English government should be based in either Birmingham, Manchester,
  or Liverpool. The Scottish government should remain in Edinburgh, and the
  Welsh government also in Cardiff.
- The regions of England should be given further political autonomy, with local
  authorities gaining much more power.
- The planning act should be abolished, with planning rules being decided at
  a local level. Large national infrastructure projects should be decided by
  either the new national governments, or by the UK political union based on
  the agreement of all nations the project would affect. Local objections
  should be curtailed unless there is a very strong case against a project.
- With Scotland gaining complete political autonomy, this should be sold as
  Scotland achieving independence, whilst retaining a pragmatic 'union' in the
  form of the UK, much like the European Union.
- Each national government should have its own public services, e.g. NHS,
  education system, etc. with funding being decentralised. Each government
  should be free to run their own public services as they see fit.
- Foreign policy should also be decentralised, with each national government
  being free to make its own foreign policy decisions. However, there should
  remain a UK foreign policy union for matters affecting all nations.
- Due to the strong difference in opinions between the publics of each nation,
  membership of the European Union should be decided at a national level.
- Northern Ireland should become part of the Republic of Ireland; any residents
  who object should be given the option to move to another nation within the UK.

Reasons why these changes are necessary:
- Decades of centralised London rule has led to managed decline and complete
  stagnation, bordering on chaos and collapse.
- There are strong political differences between the nations and strong cases
  for independence from a failing and outdated political system in Westminster.
- Reforming the UK, whilst giving Scotland political autonomy could help to
  keep the UK intact, whilst giving Scotland what it wants.
- A struggling England could benefit from having a dedicated more focussed
  government based outside of London. This would also provide an opportunity
  for modernisation and new political structures, e.g. a written constitution
  and proportional representation.
- Years of divide in Northern Ireland could be settled and ended by
  unification—initially unpopular and controversial—also preventing border issues with the EU.
