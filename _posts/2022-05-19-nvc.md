A few months ago, I read a book which changed my entire perspective on how we relate to ourselves and others. The book is called **Nonviolent Communication** by Marshall Rosenberg, and in this article, I’d like to share its core principles. Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is more than just a book: it’s a framework for communicating in a way that can increase empathy and the quality of life of those who use it and the people around them. At first, I used NVC to relate to myself since I was struggling with depression. I hope this article will make clear how NVC can help improve mental wellbeing by changing how we communicate with ourselves and others.

Firstly, we must realise that our culture has taught us to think in a way that isn’t good for us: we’ve been taught to think of ourselves and others in terms of *what we are*. This leads us to labelling ourselves and others with *moralistic judgements*, e.g., “lazy”, “selfish”, “needy”, “annoying”, etc. We can easily see how moralistic judgements can contribute to depression, e.g., “I’m a failure”, “I’m a bad husband”, “I’m lazy”, etc. We’ve all been convinced that moralistic judgements are a necessary and natural part of living, however, they are not.

NVC proposes a different way of thinking, closer to our natural state our enjoying giving and receiving. Two of the main components of NVC are **feelings** and **needs**. When we get in touch with our feelings and needs, judgements are no longer necessary; in fact, we are more likely to get what we really want.

It is important to define what feelings and needs are. In our language, we often use sentences that start with “I feel like…”, however these are often voicing opinions rather than feelings, e.g., “I feel like I didn’t get a fair deal”. Feelings are emotions free from thought or story, e.g., “joyful”, “amused”, “embarrassed”, “happy”, or “annoyed”. There are lots of pseudo feelings like “inadequate”, or “ignored”. These are not true feelings because they are not free from thought; instead, they are judgements. Feelings are free from evaluation; they just are. Our feelings reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Needs are universal, i.e., all humans have the same needs. In Max-Neef's model, needs may be categorised into nine classes: sustenance, safety, love, understanding/empathy, creativity, recreation, sense of belonging, autonomy, and meaning.

When we relate to ourselves in terms of our feelings and needs, we can become more specific about what is not making us happy, e.g., “I feel depressed” can become “I’m feeling lonely because I’m really needing some love and attention”. At first, it might seem strange to relate to yourself in this way, however, it provides greater clarity to ourselves and others on how life could be more wonderful for us.

We can also use this language when someone is doing something which isn’t meeting our needs, and we can avoid accusation or judgements. E.g., if someone is not doing the dishes as much as we’d like, instead of calling them “lazy” or “selfish”, we can say “when you leave your dishes for several days, I feel very annoyed because I’d really like the kitchen to be tidy and fairness in the housework”. This sentence lets the other person know exactly what your feelings and needs are without accusing them or judging them of anything.

It is extremely important to validate feelings which means accepting feelings for what they are. E.g., if you fail a test, a loved one might tell say “you could have done this or that…”. Compare how you would feel if you received this response to how you would feel if that loved one had said “wow, it is so hard that it didn’t turn out the way you wanted, I’m guessing you’re feeling upset right now”. After hearing the second response, I would feel much more grateful because it would meet my need for empathy and understanding, whereas the first response sounds critical. Tough love is an extremely harmful concept, and there is overwhelming evidence that compassion towards ourselves and others have a much more effective impact than harsh judgements designed to illicit guilt or shame.
NVC gives us a framework for empathising with others by listening to what’s alive in them, i.e., their feelings and needs. All human behaviour is designed to meet a certain need, even violence. In fact, violence is a strategy for meeting a need when a person thinks that other options are off the table, or have been exhausted. Many young men who are criminals have a need for power and respect, but unfortunately when these needs go unmet, human beings are prone to use violence to get what they want.

Some readers of this article will think that judgements and punishments are necessary; after all, we’ve been doing that for hundreds of years with our criminal justice system. However, there is another way of getting justice using the principles NVC called restorative justice. This is a radical approach to justice in which the parties involved in the crime—the victim and the offender—meet to share their experience of what happened, and to create a consensus of what the offender can do to repair the harm caused by their offence.

In conclusion, NVC is a framework for communicating with ourselves and others which instead of focussing on judgements, focusses on feelings and needs. Once we start to relate in this way, we are more likely to get what we want; in fact, NVC is designed to bring us closer to our natural state of giving and receiving. If you are interested in learning more, I would recommend reading Marshall Rosenberg’s book or watching one of his lectures.
